# About Project KinTrans

linedanceAI is leveraging its machine-learning platform to the deploy the first, 3D database of American Sign Language (ASL) body movements. The 3D format allows ASL, a movement-based language (sign movement happens in 3 spatial planes in relation to the body), to be analyzed in various domains as linguistics, software engineering and development, and neuroscience.  

Sign language is not only body movement, but also hand movement and facial movements communicating emotion, and meaning. This 3D body movement dataset of sign movements is complementary to these other technology stacks.

For the remainder of 2020, we seek the collaboration of research and engineering teams interested in advancing sign-technology for the NEW era of accessibility that is fast approaching. The dataset is available to view, search and analyze through an End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) found on the sign-up page.  

# About the ASL Dataset 

This project was sponsored from July 2019-June 2020 through a grant from [Microsoft AI for Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility). AI for Accessibility is a program aimed at harnessing the power of AI to amplify human capability for the more than one billion people around the world with disabilities. Microsoft does this with grants, investments of technology and expertise. Also, these applications are incorporated into platform level services, working with partners to bring the innovations to market. 

The Project KinTrans dataset contains 2820 unique sign movements, each sign movement with approximately 190 samples. In total, over 600,000 data samples were collected. The samples have been sourced from exclusively native ASL signers in Washington DC, Colorado, California and Texas and represent a wide variety of ‘style’ or ‘dialect. 

The complete release of the dataset on July 31, 2020 will include all signs with skeletal viewer; a query feature by location, context, English gloss, and lexical class, side by side to analysis features and learning models.
